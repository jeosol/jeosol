### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have an engineer with interests in optimization, machine learning/AI, software development of large and complex software. These days I primarily program in **Python** and **Common Lisp** but in the past I haved with **Matlab** and **C/C++**.

- In the past 4 years, I worked on a large-scale integrated application (~260 KLOC in Common Lisp) that is not hosted on Github. However, I am allowed to show other summaries or visualizations of the repository and here is a Gource visualization of the repository updated till September 2021. Also, <a href="https://github.com/jeosol/aiml/blob/main/remote_simulation_analysis.ipynb"> here </a> is a page showing one of the applications of the tool for performing remote physics simulations (also called reservoir simulation in oil and gas industry). The application was also used to generate the results presented at this <a href="http://onwunalu.com/petroleum/" blog </a>. The project will be presented at a confererence next year.

- I am also involved in developing web interfaces for the above project using Django and React. 

I'm best reached via email.
