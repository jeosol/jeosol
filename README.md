### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have an engineer with interests in optimization, machine learning/AI, software development of large and complex software. These days I primarily program in Python and Common Lisp but in the past I haved with Matlab and C/C++.

- In the past 4-5 years, I worked on a large-scale integrated application (~260 KLOC in Common Lisp) that is not hosted on Github. However, I am allowed to show other summaries or visualizations of the repository and here is a Gource visualization of the repository updated till September 2021. Also, here is a page showing one of the applications of the tool for performing remote physics simulations (also called reservoir simulation in oil and gas industry). 

- I am also involved in developing web interfaces for the above project using Django and React. 

I'm best reached via email.
