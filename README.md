### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an engineer with interests in optimization, machine learning/AI, large-scale software design and implementation. I studied Petroleum Engineering in school and my research focused on developing efficient algorithms and workflows for large optimization problems with application focused in the oil and gas industry. 

These days I primarily program in **Python** and **Common Lisp** but in the past I haved used other programming languages like **Prolog**, **Matlab** and **C/C++**.

- In the past 5 years, I worked on a large-scale integrated application (~260 KLOC in Common Lisp) that is not hosted on Github. However, I am allowed to show other summaries or visualizations of the repository and <a href="https://youtu.be/9MBzpy3MYfs">here</a> is a Gource visualization of the repository updated till September 2021. Also, <a href="https://github.com/jeosol/aiml/blob/main/remote_simulation_analysis.ipynb"> here </a> is a Python notebook showing one of the applications of the tool for performing remote physics simulations (also called reservoir simulation in oil and gas industry). The tool was also used to generate the results presented at this <a href="http://onwunalu.com/petroleum/"> blog </a>. I have written a paper about this project and it will be presented  at a confererence next year.

- I am also involved in developing simple web application interfaces for the above project using Django and React. 

I'm best reached via email.
